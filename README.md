# Analysing Public Opinion about Technology during the Second Industrial Revolution

This project aims to analyse public opinion on technology during the Second Industrial Revolution. More
specifically, it uses computational methods on newspaper articles from four different newspapers based in
Germany, France, the United States and Spain to detect topics in different decades and journals that can
later be compared. These topics are detected using Topic Modeling. They are then transformed into word
embeddings in a multi-dimensional space using cross-lingual word embeddings to tackle the multilingual
aspect. Finally, the topics are connected into a network in which clusters are detected. The topics within these
clusters as well as their similarities and deviations across time and countries can help us interpret both how
each country affronted emerging technologies, and how their approach compared to other countries.
